## About

As a student in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program in DC, I started this blog to share some of my new coding skills. Check me out on [github](http://github.com/ddayporter) or find me on Twitter at [@ddayporter](http://twitter.com/ddayporter).

### What's with the handle?

My birthday is June 6, which is also the date of the "[D-Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings)" invasion of Normandy during World War II. Blazow!
